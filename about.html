            <h2>Our Philosophy <i class="fa-solid fa-earth-americas"></i></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>No matter what your age, ability or experience level, Fishing is a great way to get active outdoors and has many proven health benefits. 
                <br>
               Whether it is just for a quick hour at your local lake, canal or river or spending a whole day with friends and family by the sea give fishing a go and join the millions of people who enjoy it each year.<br>
            </p>

            <h2>Fishing Advantages <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i></h2>
            <hr>
            <p> Involves a whole range of low, medium and high intensity physical activity.<br>
                Is brilliant for relaxation and aids concentration.<br>
                Helps build up your relationships and confidence which can reduce isolation.<br>
                Allows you to become more physically active at a pace that suits you, whatever your age.<br>
                Can be incorporated with other activities such as walking or cycling to a fishing venue.<br>
                Is a good way to spend time with family and enjoy an activity together.<br>

            <h2>Costs <i class="fa-solid fa-money-bill-wave"></i></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Most of these sessions are free or very low cost and include the use of tackle, bait and a rod-licence for the day. <br>
               After that all you will need is some low-cost tackle, a rod licence and a day-ticket or club membership to access some fishing venues.<br>

               As part of this, angling clubs, fisheries and organisations run taster sessions which give beginners the opportunity to try fishing for the first time.<br>

            <h2>Equipment needed <i class="fa-solid fa-fish"></i></h2>
            <hr>
            <p> You can enjoy fishing with the most basic equipment available.<br>
                You can ask your local club, fishery or tackle shop to help you pick what you need to get started.<br>
                A pair of sunglasses, a hat and waterproofs or a brolly can be useful if the weather changes.<br>
                When you start fishing you will need to buy a rod licence if you are 17 or over and want to fish in freshwater, but for junior anglers rod licences are free.<br>
